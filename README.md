# Hand and Object Tracking using the Intel RealSense Camera

Blind and visually impaired people, especially from a young age, have difficulties in perceiving and conceptualizing
their surrounding environment due to lack of visual feedback. Research in this field suggests that unsighted
individuals tend to compensate for the lack of vision through their other senses such as hearing, touching, tasting
and smelling. Recently, a study conducted by Wilson and Brewster, which experimented with dynamic
feedback sounds coming out of objects in peri-personal space, has had promising results on improving accuracy
of reaching. However, the system used to perform the experiment was technologically complex, unreliable and
closed for extensions. The purpose of this report is to present an alternative system using the Intel RealSense
F200 camera, which provides improvements in terms of hardware, software and acts as a solid base for
further additions. The approach taken towards the project was a Hybrid methodology and evaluation has shown
that the system is ready to be used in practical experiments. Finally, the system fulfils the software engineering
attributes of a great software product.
